## 10.4 Deixis: Meaning that depends on context
This section focuses on **deictic expressions** which are words and phrases that refer to different things every time they are used. These phrases mean can many something else completely depending on the context.
The section is presented with a video as well as a transcribed script.
The section begins with a revision of word extensions. Then the authors move on to deictic expressions. An example of those expression is given with pronouns *I*, *me* or *myself* - these words refer to different people depending on who is speaking. The same can be said about third person pronouns such as *she*. It will refer to a different female person depending on the context. This is universal to all languages.
**Spatial deixis** are those which refer to different locations. One example of this phenomena is the word *here* which refers to different locations based on the speaker and their position in an area. **Proximal and distal deixis** refer to the near/far distinction, e.g. *this* and *that.*
Languages such as Spanish, Arabic or Korean also have a **medial deixis**. These have more than 2 referants of distance. Finally, **temporal deixis** refer to time. An example of this is shown using the word *tomorrow*, you do not know which day of the week it is unless you are aware of the current day of the week.
The authors end the section by stating that the most popular deictic expressions are personal.

## 10.5 Pragmatics and the Cooperative Principle
In this section of the chapter, the conversational implicatures are explained on the basis of Gricean Maxims. These maxis where proposed by a philosoper H.P. Grice.
The author begins the section by introducing vocabulary. 
**Entailnment** - a semantic relation which states that if P entails Q and P is true then Q must also be true. Another relations presented in the section are **presupposition** and **implicature**. The former means that if Q is false, then the first sentenced cannot be analyzed. The latter states that P implicates Q if a listener would infer Q on the basis of P.
The main focus of this section is placed on **conversational implicatures** - these are implicatures which arise from the structure of the conversations and our understanding of communication. There are for maxims in Cooperative Principle:

 1. Maxim of Quantity
 2. Maxim of Quality
 3. Maxim of Relation
 4. Maxim of Manner 

These maxims can be **violated** or **flouted**. Violating a maxim means that we simply fail to follow it, while flouting refersing to inteantionally failing in order to communicate something.
The maxim of  **quantity**  states:
-   Make your contribution as informative as is required.
-   Do not make your contribution more informative than is required.

The maxim of  **quality**  states:
-   Do not say what you believe to be false.
-   Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence.

The maxim of  **relevance**  states:
-   Be relevant.

The maxim of  **manner**  states:
-   Avoid obscurity of expression. (That is, don’t use words or phrases that are hard to understand.)
-   Avoid ambiguity.
-   Be brief.
-   Be orderly.

By flouting these maxims we can communicate something without necesarily saying it. For example we might flout the maxim of relevance by saying something completely irrevalant, this way we communicate that we would like to change the topic of the conversation.
