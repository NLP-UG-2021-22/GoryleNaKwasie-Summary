## 9.1: Ambiguity
The first paragraph is subjected to the revision of Chapter 8. The topics which were touched upon in that chapter were **parse trees** and **Deep Structure**. 

The next paragraph begins with the extension of the idea that sentence semantics is interlinked with its syntax by explaining the phenomenon of **compositionality**. According to that concept, it is the words meaning and their morphosyntactic structures that constitute meaning. Words or phrases which have more than one meaning are termed **ambiguous**. In such cases, there are often 2 grammatical (or more) ways to combine the sentences. Consequently, we can create more than one parse three to depict **syntactic ambiguity**. 

The last defined topic is **lexical ambiguity**, which differs from structural ambiguity because it concerns specifically words with multiple meanings. The usage of such words in a sentence might cause misunderstanding when the context is missing.

## 10.1 Deixis: Elements of Word Meaning: Intensions and Extensions

This section focuses on how our minds represent the meanings of words. We can either point to an embodiment of a thing or describe its properties. Meanings of words can be defined by **denotations,** also called **extensions**. These are references to the real world’s examples. Meanings can also be defined by **intensions** – lists of things a word can refer to.

When it comes to **denotations**, they are important elements of word meaning, but they do not stand for the entire meaning of a word on their own. For example, a denotation for the Prime Minister of Canada can be Justin Trudeau. However, once the position gets assigned to someone else, the denotation will change. Similarly, the President of Canada has no denotation; however, it still carries an understandable meaning. 

As for an **intension**, it is our mental definition of a word. For example, a list of attributes that a thing needs to be equipped with for us to denote it as a bird is our intension. In that case, these could be: a creature with feathers, wings, and claws, it lays eggs, can fly, and so forth. 

Another important element to the meaning of a word is its **connotation**, which stands for the mental associations or feelings we have in connection to a word. Namely, words can have negative or positive connotations. They vary among people due to cultural differences; however, people who share a mental grammar often also share words’ connotations. 

In conclusion, our mental definition of a word is **an intension**, the things in the world that a word refers to are its **extension** or **denotation**, and most words also have **connotations** as part of their meanings.

## 10.4 Deixis: Meaning that depends on context
This section focuses on **deictic expressions** which are words and phrases that refer to different things every time they are used. These phrases mean can many something else completely depending on the context.
The section is presented with a video as well as a transcribed script.
The section begins with a revision of word extensions. Then the authors move on to deictic expressions. An example of those expression is given with pronouns *I*, *me* or *myself* - these words refer to different people depending on who is speaking. The same can be said about third person pronouns such as *she*. It will refer to a different female person depending on the context. This is universal to all languages.
**Spatial deixis** are those which refer to different locations. One example of this phenomena is the word *here* which refers to different locations based on the speaker and their position in an area. **Proximal and distal deixis** refer to the near/far distinction, e.g. *this* and *that.*
Languages such as Spanish, Arabic or Korean also have a **medial deixis**. These have more than 2 referants of distance. Finally, **temporal deixis** refer to time. An example of this is shown using the word *tomorrow*, you do not know which day of the week it is unless you are aware of the current day of the week.
The authors end the section by stating that the most popular deictic expressions are personal.

## 10.5 Pragmatics and the Cooperative Principle
In this section of the chapter, the conversational implicatures are explained on the basis of Gricean Maxims. These maxis where proposed by a philosoper H.P. Grice.
The author begins the section by introducing vocabulary. 
**Entailnment** - a semantic relation which states that if P entails Q and P is true then Q must also be true. Another relations presented in the section are **presupposition** and **implicature**. The former means that if Q is false, then the first sentenced cannot be analyzed. The latter states that P implicates Q if a listener would infer Q on the basis of P.
The main focus of this section is placed on **conversational implicatures** - these are implicatures which arise from the structure of the conversations and our understanding of communication. There are for maxims in Cooperative Principle:

 1. Maxim of Quantity
 2. Maxim of Quality
 3. Maxim of Relation
 4. Maxim of Manner 

These maxims can be **violated** or **flouted**. Violating a maxim means that we simply fail to follow it, while flouting refersing to inteantionally failing in order to communicate something.
The maxim of  **quantity**  states:
-   Make your contribution as informative as is required.
-   Do not make your contribution more informative than is required.

The maxim of  **quality**  states:
-   Do not say what you believe to be false.
-   Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence.

The maxim of  **relevance**  states:
-   Be relevant.

The maxim of  **manner**  states:
-   Avoid obscurity of expression. (That is, don’t use words or phrases that are hard to understand.)
-   Avoid ambiguity.
-   Be brief.
-   Be orderly.

By flouting these maxims we can communicate something without necesarily saying it. For example we might flout the maxim of relevance by saying something completely irrevalant, this way we communicate that we would like to change the topic of the conversation.
