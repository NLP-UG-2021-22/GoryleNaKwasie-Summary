### Marta Stanisławowska & Kasia Przerada - Chapter 9

## 9.1: Ambiguity
The first paragraph is subjected to the revision of Chapter 8. The topics which were touched upon in that chapter were **parse trees** and **Deep Structure**. 

The next paragraph begins with the extension of the idea that sentence semantics is interlinked with its syntax by explaining the phenomenon of **compositionality**. According to that concept, it is the words meaning and their morphosyntactic structures that constitute meaning. Words or phrases which have more than one meaning are termed **ambiguous**. In such cases, there are often 2 grammatical (or more) ways to combine the sentences. Consequently, we can create more than one parse three to depict **syntactic ambiguity**. 

The last defined topic is **lexical ambiguity**, which differs from structural ambiguity because it concerns specifically words with multiple meanings. The usage of such words in a sentence might cause misunderstanding when the context is missing.

## 9.2: Events, Participants and Thematic Roles

The main theme of this subchapter is what sentences mean. Sentences describe events or states in the world, and events typically have participants: the people or things who take part in the event. It turns out that even in events that are very different from one another, some participants share some meaning. 
Each sentence's grammatical role is that of a subject. Semantically, the events described by each sentence are quite different. However, even across these various events, the participants described by the underlined noun phrases share some semantic similarities: all of them choose to participate in the event, and all of them cause the event to occur.

Even if some group of sentences have the same verb, they do not share the same semantic properties. Grammatical roles are used to indicate a noun phrase's syntactic position in a sentence. Moreover there is a new type of label called thematic roles. They are used to identify the common semantic properties of event participants. It is important to note that they are unaffected by grammatical roles.

Some noun phrases have different grammatical roles, and one of the most common is called a theme, or in some books, you'll see it called a patient. Theme participants typically undergo events, that is, events happen to them. They're affected by events, and often they change state or position as a result of those events.
Because the cause is inanimate, a cause participant shares the agentive property of causing an event to occur, but it does not choose to cause it. Some languages distinguish between an animate agent and an inanimate cause morphologically. We assign the label cause to these inanimate participants.

Furthermore, labels such as cause, instrument, and location are used to describe some of the roles that inanimate participants typically play in events.
Thematic role labels capture the semantic properties of event participants regardless of the noun phrase's syntactic position.

Simply because something has the grammatical role of a subject does not imply that it has the thematic role of an agent, and vice versa.
There is some debate in the literature about how many thematic roles are required to capture the relevant patterns of behavior in the world's languages, but we'll take the middle ground and use six.

## 9.3: Thematic Roles and Passive Sentence
In English, as well as in many other languages, the agent very often takes the position of a subject in a sentence, whereas the object position is prevailingly occupied by the theme role. 
In order to reverse the usual order between thematic and grammatical roles, the **passive structure** is used. In this construction,  the semantic roles do not change, but their grammatical roles do. Passive is often used to draw attention to the ***action***, not to the doer of this action. The distinguishable structure of passive voice is the verb *be* in some form followed by a past participle. 
Interestingly, some languages manage to reverse the usual mapping of thematic roles by morphology on the verb or with morphology on the noun.

## 9.5 Neurolinguistics and Second Language Learning
Our native language is referred to by linguists as **L1** whereas our second language is called an **L2**. Three major differences between the acquisition of L1 and L2 are: cognitive processes changes, the consciousness of learning, and transfer. 

Since L2 is acquired later than L1, the cognitive abilities of an older learner are different from that of a child. Moreover, L1 is learned, in a large part, unconsciously. On the contrary, L2 learners need to put some effort to gather new information. Last but not least, the mental grammar of L1 can affect the acquisition of L2. This influence called **transfer**, can be **positive**, when the knowledge of L1 creates helpful connotations for learning L2, or **negative** when the structures of L2 are completely different from L1, thus studying L2 is constricted.

The first hypothesis tested in this chapter is that the mental grammar of proficient L2 speakers should be similar to their L1 mental grammar. In a study by Anja Hahne, the testing group consisted of Russians who moved to Germany in their 20s and lived there for an average of 6 years, whereas the control group was native Germans. The results validated the given hypothesis, due to the fact that the **electrophysiological responses** (N400) of testing group brains were closely resembling the control group.

The second assumption, based on previous research, is that the L2 learners never reach proficiency in their L2 morphosyntax. Nevertheless, the Harried Browden et.al research showed contradicting evidence. The advanced L2 Spanish learners from England, who were learning Spanish for at least 3 years at university, and additionally had been to a Spanish-speaking country for a year, showed similar **P600** responses to sentences that were syntactically violated to those of native Spanish speakers. 

However, the study in Montreal proved that developing L2 mental grammar similar to native representatives ***does not have to take a long time***. Asian students who participated in a 9-weeks crash course in English showed P600 responses to the syntactically incorrect sentences. Consequently, intensive language learning yields the same results as longer, slower language acquisition.

## 10.1 Deixis: Elements of Word Meaning: Intensions and Extensions
This section focuses on how our minds represent the meanings of words. We can either point to an embodiment of a thing or describe its properties. Meanings of words can be defined by **denotations,** also called **extensions**. These are references to the real world’s examples. Meanings can also be defined by **intensions** – lists of things a word can refer to.

When it comes to **denotations**, they are important elements of word meaning, but they do not stand for the entire meaning of a word on their own. For example, a denotation for the Prime Minister of Canada can be Justin Trudeau. However, once the position gets assigned to someone else, the denotation will change. Similarly, the President of Canada has no denotation; however, it still carries an understandable meaning. 

As for an **intension**, it is our mental definition of a word. For example, a list of attributes that a thing needs to be equipped with for us to denote it as a bird is our intension. In that case, these could be: a creature with feathers, wings, and claws, it lays eggs, can fly, and so forth. 

Another important element to the meaning of a word is its **connotation**, which stands for the mental associations or feelings we have in connection to a word. Namely, words can have negative or positive connotations. They vary among people due to cultural differences; however, people who share a mental grammar often also share words’ connotations. 

In conclusion, our mental definition of a word is **an intension**, the things in the world that a word refers to are its **extension** or **denotation**, and most words also have **connotations** as part of their meanings.

## 10.2 Intensions in the Mind
This unit focuses on ways intensions can be organized in our minds. Namely, they can be organized around sets of **binary features** that divide the world into clear-cut categories or around **fuzzy categories** that have both prototypical and peripheral members.

When it comes to **binary features**, the intension for the word bird could be made of features like [+living], [-mammal], [+wings], [+eggs],   [+flying]. Some of these features could also describe other words. For example, similar features can denote a fish, with the difference of [-wings], [-flying], [+swimming]. Such a feature composition, also known as componential analysis, captures similarities and differences across categories of things in the world.

However, it has some **issues**. For example, a penguin is a member of the bird category, but it cannot fly and it can swim. A penguin is a bird, yet it doesn’t have all features associated with the word. If our intensions were organized just as binary features, we wouldn’t be able to represent the meaning of some words.

Another theory of intensions consists of **fuzzy categories**. They contain **exemplars**, which are our memories of every time we’ve encountered an extension of the word. Exemplars can be prototypical when they have all the typical attributes of members of that category. For example, for most North Americans a robin is a prototypical exemplar of the category bird. Some exemplars are peripheral when they have fewer defining attributes and include some that are untypical. A peripheral exemplar of the category bird could be a penguin.

## 10.3 Psycholinguistics of Word Meanings
This section focuses on **behavioral psycholinguistics**. In an experiment, participants took part in a **rapid naming** task – they saw words appear on a screen and had to say them out loud. Some words referred to prototypical exemplars of their categories and some to peripheral exemplars. The researchers established that people were able to name the prototypes faster than the peripheral exemplars after naming the words they saw. The researchers used the same words in a **lexical decision task**, where a word appears briefly on a screen and the participants decide whether it’s a real word or not. Again, the researchers demonstrated that people make decisions faster when confronted with a word referring to a peripheral member. These findings indicate that it is easier to recognize a word when it refers to a prototype.

A task called **priming** investigates relationships between words. In a **primed lexical decision** task, a word called the **prime** appears on the screen. It disappears, and a second word called the **target** appears. The participant makes a lexical decision about the target, choosing whether a connection between the two exists. Psychologists and psycholinguists have conducted thousands of experiments on priming. The scientific literature on the issue indicates that priming between words occurs when words are either members of the same category, are synonyms, antonyms, or are words that describe things that share some attributes. For example, an orange and a ball are both spheres, so they can prime each other.

Such priming effects demonstrate that semantic relationships play an important role in our minds’ organization of the meanings of words.

## 10.4 Deixis: Meaning that depends on context
This section focuses on **deictic expressions** which are words and phrases that refer to different things every time they are used. These phrases mean can many something else completely depending on the context.
The section is presented with a video as well as a transcribed script.
The section begins with a revision of word extensions. Then the authors move on to deictic expressions. An example of those expression is given with pronouns *I*, *me* or *myself* - these words refer to different people depending on who is speaking. The same can be said about third person pronouns such as *she*. It will refer to a different female person depending on the context. This is universal to all languages.
**Spatial deixis** are those which refer to different locations. One example of this phenomena is the word *here* which refers to different locations based on the speaker and their position in an area. **Proximal and distal deixis** refer to the near/far distinction, e.g. *this* and *that.*
Languages such as Spanish, Arabic or Korean also have a **medial deixis**. These have more than 2 referants of distance. Finally, **temporal deixis** refer to time. An example of this is shown using the word *tomorrow*, you do not know which day of the week it is unless you are aware of the current day of the week.
The authors end the section by stating that the most popular deictic expressions are personal.

## 10.5 Pragmatics and the Cooperative Principle
In this section of the chapter, the conversational implicatures are explained on the basis of Gricean Maxims. These maxis where proposed by a philosoper H.P. Grice.
The author begins the section by introducing vocabulary. 
**Entailnment** - a semantic relation which states that if P entails Q and P is true then Q must also be true. Another relations presented in the section are **presupposition** and **implicature**. The former means that if Q is false, then the first sentenced cannot be analyzed. The latter states that P implicates Q if a listener would infer Q on the basis of P.
The main focus of this section is placed on **conversational implicatures** - these are implicatures which arise from the structure of the conversations and our understanding of communication. There are for maxims in Cooperative Principle:

 1. Maxim of Quantity
 2. Maxim of Quality
 3. Maxim of Relation
 4. Maxim of Manner 

These maxims can be **violated** or **flouted**. Violating a maxim means that we simply fail to follow it, while flouting refersing to inteantionally failing in order to communicate something.
The maxim of  **quantity**  states:
-   Make your contribution as informative as is required.
-   Do not make your contribution more informative than is required.

The maxim of  **quality**  states:
-   Do not say what you believe to be false.
-   Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence.

The maxim of  **relevance**  states:
-   Be relevant.

The maxim of  **manner**  states:
-   Avoid obscurity of expression. (That is, don’t use words or phrases that are hard to understand.)
-   Avoid ambiguity.
-   Be brief.
-   Be orderly.

By flouting these maxims we can communicate something without necesarily saying it. For example we might flout the maxim of relevance by saying something completely irrevalant, this way we communicate that we would like to change the topic of the conversation.
