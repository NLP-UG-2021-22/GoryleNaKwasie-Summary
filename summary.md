## 9.1: Ambiguity
The first paragraph is subjected to the revision of Chapter 8. The topics which were touched upon in that chapter were **parse trees** and **Deep Structure**. 

The next paragraph begins with the extension of the idea that sentence semantics is interlinked with its syntax by explaining the phenomenon of **compositionality**. According to that concept, it is the words meaning and their morphosyntactic structures that constitute meaning. Words or phrases which have more than one meaning are termed **ambiguous**. In such cases, there are often 2 grammatical (or more) ways to combine the sentences. Consequently, we can create more than one parse three to depict **syntactic ambiguity**. 

The last defined topic is **lexical ambiguity**, which differs from structural ambiguity because it concerns specifically words with multiple meanings. The usage of such words in a sentence might cause misunderstanding when the context is missing.

## 9.3: Thematic Roles and Passive Sentence
In English, as well as in many other languages, the agent very often takes the position of a subject in a sentence, whereas the object position is prevailingly occupied by the theme role. 

In order to reverse the usual order between thematic and grammatical roles, the **passive structure** is used. In this construction,  the semantic roles do not change, but their grammatical roles do. Passive is often used to draw attention to the ***action***, not to the doer of this action. The distinguishable structure of passive voice is the verb *be* in some form followed by a past participle. 

Interestingly, some languages manage to reverse the usual mapping of thematic roles by morphology on the verb or with morphology on the noun.

## 9.5 Neurolinguistics and Second Language Learning
Our native language is referred to by linguists as **L1** whereas our second language is called an **L2**. Three major differences between the acquisition of L1 and L2 are: cognitive processes changes, the consciousness of learning, and transfer. Since L2 is acquired later than L1, the cognitive abilities of an older learner are different from that of a child. Moreover, L1 is learned, in a large part, unconsciously. On the contrary, L2 learners need to put some effort to gather new information. Last but not least, the mental grammar of L1 can affect the acquisition of L2. This influence called **transfer**, can be **positive**, when the knowledge of L1 creates helpful connotations for learning L2, or **negative** when the structures of L2 are completely different from L1, thus studying L2 is constricted.

The first hypothesis tested in this chapter is that the mental grammar of proficient L2 speakers should be similar to their L1 mental grammar. In a study by Anja Hahne, the testing group consisted of Russians who moved to Germany in their 20s and lived there for an average of 6 years, whereas the control group was native Germans. The results validated the given hypothesis, due to the fact that the **electrophysiological responses** (N400) of testing group brains were closely resembling the control group.

The second assumption, based on previous research, is that the L2 learners never reach proficiency in their L2 morphosyntax. Nevertheless, the Harried Browden et.al research showed contradicting evidence. The advanced L2 Spanish learners from England, who were learning Spanish for at least 3 years at university, and additionally had been to a Spanish-speaking country for a year, showed similar **P600** responses to sentences that were syntactically violated to those of native Spanish speakers. 

However, the study in Montreal proved that developing L2 mental grammar similar to native representatives ***does not have to take a long time***. Asian students who participated in a 9-weeks crash course in English showed P600 responses to the syntactically incorrect sentences. Consequently, intensive language learning yields the same results as longer, slower language acquisition.

## 10.4 Deixis: Meaning that depends on context
This section focuses on **deictic expressions** which are words and phrases that refer to different things every time they are used. These phrases mean can many something else completely depending on the context.
The section is presented with a video as well as a transcribed script.
The section begins with a revision of word extensions. Then the authors move on to deictic expressions. An example of those expression is given with pronouns *I*, *me* or *myself* - these words refer to different people depending on who is speaking. The same can be said about third person pronouns such as *she*. It will refer to a different female person depending on the context. This is universal to all languages.
**Spatial deixis** are those which refer to different locations. One example of this phenomena is the word *here* which refers to different locations based on the speaker and their position in an area. **Proximal and distal deixis** refer to the near/far distinction, e.g. *this* and *that.*
Languages such as Spanish, Arabic or Korean also have a **medial deixis**. These have more than 2 referants of distance. Finally, **temporal deixis** refer to time. An example of this is shown using the word *tomorrow*, you do not know which day of the week it is unless you are aware of the current day of the week.
The authors end the section by stating that the most popular deictic expressions are personal.

## 10.5 Pragmatics and the Cooperative Principle
In this section of the chapter, the conversational implicatures are explained on the basis of Gricean Maxims. These maxis where proposed by a philosoper H.P. Grice.
The author begins the section by introducing vocabulary. 
**Entailnment** - a semantic relation which states that if P entails Q and P is true then Q must also be true. Another relations presented in the section are **presupposition** and **implicature**. The former means that if Q is false, then the first sentenced cannot be analyzed. The latter states that P implicates Q if a listener would infer Q on the basis of P.
The main focus of this section is placed on **conversational implicatures** - these are implicatures which arise from the structure of the conversations and our understanding of communication. There are for maxims in Cooperative Principle:

 1. Maxim of Quantity
 2. Maxim of Quality
 3. Maxim of Relation
 4. Maxim of Manner 

These maxims can be **violated** or **flouted**. Violating a maxim means that we simply fail to follow it, while flouting refersing to inteantionally failing in order to communicate something.
The maxim of  **quantity**  states:
-   Make your contribution as informative as is required.
-   Do not make your contribution more informative than is required.

The maxim of  **quality**  states:
-   Do not say what you believe to be false.
-   Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence.

The maxim of  **relevance**  states:
-   Be relevant.

The maxim of  **manner**  states:
-   Avoid obscurity of expression. (That is, don’t use words or phrases that are hard to understand.)
-   Avoid ambiguity.
-   Be brief.
-   Be orderly.

By flouting these maxims we can communicate something without necesarily saying it. For example we might flout the maxim of relevance by saying something completely irrevalant, this way we communicate that we would like to change the topic of the conversation.
